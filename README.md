## About

I built this app to be a simple and intuitive journal to track my lifts. There were some guys/gals at the gym that carried around a notebook, I thought that it was good to track them, but could not be bothered to carry around a bag with pencil and paper. We have ChatGPT for goodness sake, certainly there is a digital way of doing it. So I looked through the app store and sure enough, there are apps that do this, but it's more of an afterthought, a feature that is burried in an expensive, complicated application. I wanted to do something simple and to the point. Hence, Simple Gym Journal. I kept it cheap, easy to use, and no subscriptions or ads or any of that nonsense. Just an easy to use and simple app to do what you want it to do. I hope you enjoy it!
